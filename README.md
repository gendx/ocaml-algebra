# ocaml-algebra - an algebra system written in OCaml [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gendx/ocaml-algebra.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gendx/ocaml-algebra)

This algebra system makes extensive use of OCaml modules and functors, which give a nice representation of abtract algebraic types : groups, rings, fields, algebras...

It currently implements :
* polynomials (mono- and multivariate).
* linear structures such as matrices and vectors.
* structures such as fraction fields or quotient.
* as well as common structures like Z, Q...
